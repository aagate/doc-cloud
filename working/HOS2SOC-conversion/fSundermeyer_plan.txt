Sheilagh, would you mind sharing your plans? Carl, what are the areas in 
which you need our help? Here is what we can offer:

* We would like to invite you to our weekly team meeting. This will be a 
 chance for you to get to know the whole team and to discuss matters   
 with all of us
 The meeting takes place on Tuesdays, at 15:00 MET - that must be 06:00 
 your time. probably a bit too early ;-) Would 1:00 or 1:30 hours later 
 be acceptable for you? 
* We can do online trainings where we can teach you how to use our 
 toolchain and processes
* Dmitri Popov (dpopov@suse.de) will work on SOC8 docs from the 
 Nuremberg side. We can offer regular sync-up meetings. We should 
 probably also make plans on how to distribute the work between Carl 
 and Dmitri 

My suggestion for getting you, Carl, started, would be to identify all 
parts of the HOS documentation that will get integrated/added to the 
existing SOC8 documentation. Once these pieces are identified, we can 
convert and merge the respective sources into the existing SOC8 
repository.
