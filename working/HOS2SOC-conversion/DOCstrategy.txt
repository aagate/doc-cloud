Frank and Dima

Rick Salevsky
release mgr Cloud 8
not many changes on SUSE
Ansible and Ardana - changes
SUSE & Python 3

Ardana - installation routine
analyze 

2 methods
SUSE - usual with crowbar/chef
HOS - Ardana

2 different deployment guides - SUSE and HOS
way too messy otherwise
Frank

workflow
solely on content; XML only
stylesheets take care of final document production

point releases not CI

docserve - daily build is published
for developers

what content of HOS we reuse for Cloud 8

cloud 9 get rid of crowbar and chef
take HOS and carry it on

services are upstream dependent

suse OC supplement

throw away USER GUIDE on HOS

security section in HOS could go across to SUSE

**life cycle management - why this is a big deal?
to FS and DP cloud 8 or not

system administrator - TARGET AUDIENCE

screenshots are still an issue

conversion to DocBook as early as possible; start with 
introduction
planning
installation

Security and Operations are key

CARL go through Security and Operations Guide
see what needs to be done to convert those and what could migrate

for example Block Storage
handled upstream?
not big of a difference between this and HOS 

SUSE and HOS specific

CS will talk with Stefan and Thomas
Stefan Knorr; Thomas Schraitle

pointers to repositories where HOS are located
image locations
what I've found about structure

***Sheilagh any test installations that I can use as a reference cloud?
at least look at the software
all HOS stuff isn't available in Nuremberg - FS

HOS 5 instance is crucial accessible to me and SUSE Doc people

Frank
parts of HOS stack will be integrated into SOC that were not included in SOC
MySQL > MariaDB
