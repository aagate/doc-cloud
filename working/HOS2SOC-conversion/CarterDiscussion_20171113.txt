execute shell; DITA xml > HTML; CSS, JS. These don't matter.
some things are painful to deal with

dev build page

dev: build any branch hos docs 
only interesting helion open stack
don't worry about others

build looks at changes in github
automatic when change to repo and committed
when built, they go to staging not visible to anyone else

commit, look at staging server, if everything look good then promote
User: clouddocs
Password: ****
in menu

hos.docs-hos-50-HOS.ditaval

click on link to see page

promoted

published; pub move to new production

tools is a separate repo in build screen
HOS5 > Cloud 8; doesn't contain tools 

post-build actions

SUSE doc team
didn't use Jenkins
wouldn't it be cool if we had CI

SUSE seems to have
bash shell scripts


to look at promoted
 15.184.4.11:9095 same uname & pwd

stage to see if everything looks right, then do promoted to see all of the 
documentation all together
staging - individual documents
promoted - everything integrated
