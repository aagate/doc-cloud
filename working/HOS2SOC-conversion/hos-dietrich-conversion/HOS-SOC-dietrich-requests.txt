The following type of content is converted to "<phrase/>"
<keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
<ph conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/product-title"/>

it would be helpful if they would convert with more information.

<keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> 
    to KEYREF "kw-hos"
<ph conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/product-title"/> 
    to CONKEYREF "HOS-conrefs/product-title"
    

There's an issue with relative file references (such as a document 
may refer to ../../../directory/directory/file). It's not easy to cross 
reference because the converted files are in a separate directory and not at 
the same relative level. I don't see how this can be handled with scripting.

Example:
(project root is hos.docs from GitHub)
The file
    hos.docs/helion/planning/converted/planning/xml/planning-..-architecture-
alternative-entryscale_kvm_ceph_twonetwork.dita 
refers to:
    <mediaobject>
    <imageobject role="fo"><imagedata 
    fileref="media-hos.docs-entry_scale_kvm_ceph_two_network.png" 
    width="75%" format="PNG"/></imageobject><imageobject
    role="html"><imagedata 
fileref="media-hos.docs-entry_scale_kvm_ceph_two_network. png"/></imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

        <para><ulink 
url="../../../media/hos.docs/entry_scale_kvm_ceph_two_network_lg.png">Download a 
high-resolution version</ulink></para>

So while the converted files are relative to the converted directory, other 
files (not needing dietrich conversion) are in their pre-conversion locations.

Not sure how clear I'm making this. Entschuldigens bitte.
