        <title>Configure resize</title>
        <paragraph>Resize (or Server resize) is the ability to change the flavor of a server, thus
            allowing it to upscale or downscale according to user needs.  For this feature
            to work properly, you might need to configure some underlying virt layers.</paragraph>
        <section ids="kvm" names="kvm">
            <title>KVM</title>
            <paragraph>Resize on KVM is implemented currently by transferring the images between
                compute nodes over ssh. For KVM you need hostnames to resolve properly and
                passwordless ssh access between your compute hosts. Direct access from one
                compute host to another is needed to copy the VM file across.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Cloud end users can find out how to resize a server by reading the <reference name="OpenStack End User Guide" refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli_change_the_size_of_your_server.html">OpenStack
                    End User Guide</reference><target ids="openstack-end-user-guide" names="openstack\ end\ user\ guide" refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli_change_the_size_of_your_server.html"></target>.</paragraph>

            <title>XenServer</title>
            <paragraph>To get resize to work with XenServer (and XCP), you need to establish a root
                trust between all hypervisor nodes and provide an <literal>/image</literal> mount point to
                your hypervisors dom0.</paragraph>
