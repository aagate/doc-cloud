        <title>Adding a Method to the OpenStack API</title>
        <paragraph>The interface is a mostly RESTful API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and provides an architecture "style" for distributed systems using HTTP for transport. Figure out a way to express your request and response in terms of resources that are being created, modified, read, or destroyed.</paragraph>

            <title>Routing</title>
            <paragraph>To map URLs to controllers+actions, OpenStack uses the Routes package, a clone of Rails routes for Python implementations. See <reference refuri="http://routes.groovie.org/">http://routes.groovie.org/</reference> for more information.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>URLs are mapped to "action" methods on "controller" classes in <literal>nova/api/openstack/__init__/ApiRouter.__init__</literal> .</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Controllers live in <literal>nova/api/openstack</literal>, and inherit from nova.wsgi.Controller.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>See <literal>nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py</literal> for an example.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Action methods take parameters that are sucked out of the URL by mapper.connect() or .resource().  The first two parameters are self and the WebOb request, from which you can get the req.environ, req.body, req.headers, etc.</paragraph>
