        <title>Blueprints, Specs and Priorities</title>
        <paragraph>Like most OpenStack projects, Nova uses <reference name="blueprints" refuri="http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#working-on-specifications-and-blueprints">blueprints</reference> and specifications (specs) to track new
            features, but not all blueprints require a spec. This document covers when a spec is needed.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>Nova's specs live at: <reference name="specs.openstack.org" refuri="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/">specs.openstack.org</reference></paragraph>

            <paragraph>A spec is needed for any feature that requires a design discussion. All
                features need a blueprint but not all blueprints require a spec.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If a new feature is straightforward enough that it doesn't need any design
                discussion, then no spec is required. In order to provide the sort of
                documentation that would otherwise be provided via a spec, the commit
                message should include a <literal>DocImpact</literal> flag and a thorough description
                of the feature from a user/operator perspective.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>When a blueprint does not require a spec it still needs to be
                approved before the code which implements the blueprint is merged.
                Specless blueprints are discussed and potentially approved during
                the <title_reference>Open Discussion</title_reference> portion of the weekly <reference name="nova IRC meeting" refuri="http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#Nova_Team_Meeting">nova IRC meeting</reference>. See
