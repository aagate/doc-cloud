        <title>REST API Version History</title>
        <paragraph>This documents the changes made to the REST API with every
            microversion change. The description for each version should be a
            verbose one which has enough information to be suitable for use in
            user documentation.</paragraph>
        <section ids="id1" names="2.1">
            <title>2.1</title>
            <paragraph>This is the initial version of the v2.1 API which supports
                microversions. The V2.1 API is from the REST API users's point of
                view exactly the same as v2.0 except with strong input validation.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A user can specify a header in the API request:</paragraph>
            <literal_block xml:space="preserve">X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version: &lt;version&gt;</literal_block>
            <paragraph>where <literal>&lt;version&gt;</literal> is any valid api version for this API.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If no version is specified then the API will behave as if a version
                request of v2.1 was requested.</paragraph>

                in the <literal>os-keypairs</literal> plugin</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If no keypair type is specified, then the default <literal>ssh</literal> type of keypair is
                created.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Fixes status code for <literal>os-keypairs</literal> create method from 200 to 201</paragraph>
