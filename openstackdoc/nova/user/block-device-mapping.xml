        <title>Block Device Mapping in Nova</title>
        <paragraph>Nova has a concept of block devices that can be exposed to cloud instances.
            There are several types of block devices an instance can have (we will go into
            more details about this later in this document), and which ones are available
            depends on a particular deployment and the usage limitations set for tenants
            and users. Block device mapping is a way to organize and keep data about all of
            the block devices an instance has.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When we talk about block device mapping, we usually refer to one of two things</paragraph>

            <list_item>
                <paragraph>The data structure internal to Nova that is used for recording and keeping,
                    which is ultimately persisted in the block_device_mapping table. However,
                    Nova internally has several "slightly" different formats for representing
                    the same data. All of them are documented in the code and or presented by
                    a distinct set of classes, but not knowing that they exist might trip up
                    people reading the code. So in addition to BlockDeviceMapping <footnote_reference ids="id1" refid="id4">1</footnote_reference> objects
                    that mirror the database schema, we have:</paragraph>
                <paragraph>2.1 The API format - this is the set of raw key-value pairs received from
                    the API client, and is almost immediately transformed into the object;
                    however, some validations are done using this format. We will refer to this
                    format as the 'API BDMs' from now on.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>2.2 The virt driver format - this is the format defined by the classes in
                    :mod: <title_reference>nova.virt.block_device</title_reference>. This format is used and expected by the code
                    in the various virt drivers. These classes, in addition to exposing a
                    different format (mimicking the Python dict interface), also provide a place
                    to bundle some functionality common to certain types of block devices (for
                    example attaching volumes which has to interact with both Cinder and the
                    virt driver code). We will refer to this format as 'Driver BDMs' from now
                    on.</paragraph>

            <title>Data format and its history</title>
            <paragraph>In the early days of Nova, block device mapping general structure closely
                mirrored that of the EC2 API. During the Havana release of Nova, block device
                handling code, and in turn the block device mapping structure, had work done on
                improving the generality and usefulness. These improvements included exposing
                additional details and features in the API. In order to facilitate this, a new
                extension was added to the v2 API called <title_reference>BlockDeviceMappingV2Boot</title_reference> <footnote_reference ids="id2" refid="id5">2</footnote_reference>, that
                added an additional <title_reference>block_device_mapping_v2</title_reference> field to the instance boot API
                request.</paragraph>

                <title>Block device mapping v1 (aka legacy)</title>
                <paragraph>This was the original format that supported only cinder volumes (similar to how
                    EC2 block devices support only EBS volumes). Every entry was keyed by device
                    name (we will discuss why this was problematic in its own section later on
                    this page), and would accept only:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>While all of Nova internal code only uses and stores the new data structure, we
                    still need to handle API requests that use the legacy format. This is handled
                    by the Nova API service on every request. As we will see later, since block
                    device mapping information can also be stored in the image metadata in Glance,
                    this is another place where we need to handle the v1 format. The code to handle
                    legacy conversions is part of the :mod: <title_reference>nova.block_device</title_reference> module.</paragraph>

                <title>Intermezzo - problem with device names</title>
                <paragraph>Using device names as the primary per-instance identifier, and exposing them in
                    the API, is problematic for Nova mostly because several hypervisors Nova
                    supports with its drivers can't guarantee that the device names the guest OS
                    assigns are the ones the user requested from Nova. Exposing such a detail
                    in the public API of Nova is obviously not ideal, but it needed to stay for
                    backwards compatibility. It is also required for some (slightly obscure)
                    features around overloading a block device in a Glance image when booting an
                    instance <footnote_reference ids="id3" refid="id6">3</footnote_reference>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The plan for fixing this was to allow users to not specify the device name of a
                    block device, and Nova will determine it (with the help of the virt driver), so
                    that it can still be discovered through the API and used when necessary, like
                    for the features mentioned above (and preferably only then).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Another use for specifying the device name was to allow the "boot from volume"
                    functionality, by specifying a device name that matches the root device name
                    for the instance (usually <title_reference>/dev/vda</title_reference>).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Currently (mid Liberty) users are discouraged from specifying device names
                    for all calls requiring or allowing block device mapping, except when trying to
                    override the image block device mapping on instance boot, and it will likely
                    remain like that in the future. Libvirt device driver will outright override
                    any device names passed with it's own values.</paragraph>

                <title>Block device mapping v2</title>
                <paragraph>New format was introduced in an attempt to solve issues with the original
                    block device mapping format discussed above, and also to allow for more
                    flexibility and addition of features that were not possible with the simple
                    format we had.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>New block device mapping is a list of dictionaries containing the following
                    fields (in addition to the ones that were already there):</paragraph>

                            existing image metadata, final set of device names for the instance may still
                            get changed by the driver.</paragraph>

                            and may change as more support is added. Leaving these empty is the most
                            common thing to do.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>boot_index - Defines the order in which a hypervisor will try devices when
                            attempting to boot the guest from storage. Each device which is capable of
                            being used as boot device should be given a unique boot index, starting from
                            0 in ascending order. Some hypervisors may not support booting from multiple
                            devices, so will only consider the device with boot index of 0. Some
                            hypervisors will support booting from multiple devices, but only if they are
                            of different types - eg a disk and CD-ROM. Setting a negative value or None
                            indicates that the device should not be used for booting. The simplest
                            usage is to set it to 0 for the boot device and leave it as None for any
                            other devices.</paragraph>

                            (it should also be marked as a boot device). It is also worth noting
                            that an API request that specifies this, also has to provide the
                            same Glance uuid as the <title_reference>image_ref</title_reference> parameter to the boot request
                            (this is done for backwards compatibility and may be changed in the
                            future). This functionality might be extended to specify additional
                            Glance images to be attached to an instance after boot (similar to
                            kernel/ramdisk images) but this functionality is not supported by

                            It would create a volume from a Cinder volume snapshot and attach that

                            as bootable. This is really only a shortcut for creating a volume out of
