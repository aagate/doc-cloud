            <title>Tips for Doc Writers (and Developers, too!)</title>
            <paragraph>Here are some useful tips about questions that come up a lot but aren’t always
                easy to find answers to.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Make example URLs consistent</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>For consistency, example URLs for openstack components are in the form:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block classes="code" xml:space="preserve">project.openstack.example.org</literal_block>
                    <paragraph>So, for example, an example image-list call to Glance would use a URL
                        written like this:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block classes="code" xml:space="preserve">http://glance.openstack.example.org/v2/images</literal_block>

            <title>Where to Contribute</title>
            <paragraph>There are a few different kinds of documentation associated with Glance to
                which you may want to contribute:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="*">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Configuration</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>As you read through the sample configuration files in the <literal>etc</literal> directory
                        in the source tree, you may find typographical errors, or grammatical
                        problems, or text that could use clarification.  The Glance team welcomes
                        your contributions, but please note that the sample configuration files are
                        generated, not static text.  Thus you must modify the source code where the
                        particular option you’re correcting is defined and then re-generate the conf
                        file using <literal>tox -e genconfig</literal>.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Glance’s Documentation</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The Glance Documentation (what you’re reading right now) lives in the source
                        code tree under <literal>doc/source</literal>.  It consists of information for developers
                        working on Glance, information for consumers of the OpenStack Images APIs
                        implemented by Glance, and information for operators deploying Glance.  Thus
                        there’s a wide range of documents to which you could contribute.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Small improvements can simply be addressed by a patch, but it’s probably a
                        good idea to first file a bug for larger changes so they can be tracked more
                        easily (especially if you plan to submit several different patches to address
                        the shortcoming).</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>User Guides</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>There are several user guides published by the OpenStack Documentation Team.
                        Please see the README in their code repository for more information:
                        <reference refuri="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals">https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals</reference></paragraph>

                    <paragraph>OpenStack API Reference</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>There’s a “quick reference” guide to the APIs implemented by Glance:
                        <reference refuri="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/">http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/</reference></paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The guide is generated from source files in the source code tree under
                        <literal>api-ref/source</literal>.  Corrections in spelling or typographical errors may be
                        addressed directly by a patch.  If you note a divergence between the API
                        reference and the actual behavior of Glance, please file a bug before
                        submitting a patch.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Additionally, now that the quick reference guides are being maintained by
                        each project (rather than a central team), you may note divergences in format
                        between the Glance guides and those of other teams.  For example, some
                        projects may have adopted an informative new way to display error codes.  If
                        you notice structural improvements that our API reference is missing, please
                        file a bug.  And, of course, we would also welcome your patch implementing
                        the improvement!</paragraph>

            <title>Release Notes</title>
            <paragraph>Release notes are notes available for operators to get an idea what each
                project has included and changed during a cycle. They may also include
                various warnings and notices.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Generating release notes is done with Reno.</paragraph>
            <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="bash" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">$ tox -e venv -- reno new &lt;bug-,bp-,whatever&gt;</literal_block>
            <paragraph>This will generate a yaml file in <literal>releasenotes/notes</literal> that will contain
                instructions about how to fill in (or remove) the various sections of
                the document. Modify the yaml file as appropriate and include it as
                part of your commit.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Commit your note to git (required for reno to pick it up):</paragraph>
            <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="bash" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">$ git add releasenotes/notes/&lt;note&gt;; git commit</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Once the release notes have been committed you can build them by using:</paragraph>
            <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="bash" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">$ tox -e releasenotes</literal_block>
            <paragraph>This will create the HTML files under <literal>releasenotes/build/html/</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <literal>prelude</literal> section in the release notes is to highlight only the
                important changes of the release. Please word your note accordingly and be
                judicious when adding content there. We don’t encourage extraneous notes and at
                the same time we don’t want to miss out on important ones. In short, not every
                release note will need content in the <literal>prelude</literal> section. If what you’re
                working on required a spec, then a prelude is appropriate. If you’re submitting
                a bugfix, most likely not; a spec-lite is a judgement call.</paragraph>
