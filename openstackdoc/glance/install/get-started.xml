        <title>Image service overview</title>
        <paragraph>The Image service (glance) enables users to discover,
            register, and retrieve virtual machine images. It offers a
            <reference internal="True" refuri="../glossary#term-restful"><inline classes="xref std std-term">REST</inline></reference> API that enables you to query virtual
            machine image metadata and retrieve an actual image.
            You can store virtual machine images made available through
            the Image service in a variety of locations, from simple file
            systems to object-storage systems like OpenStack Object Storage.</paragraph>
        <important>
            <paragraph>For simplicity, this guide describes configuring the Image service to
                use the <literal>file</literal> back end, which uploads and stores in a
                directory on the controller node hosting the Image service. By
                default, this directory is <literal>/var/lib/glance/images/</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Before you proceed, ensure that the controller node has at least
                several gigabytes of space available in this directory. Keep in
                mind that since the <literal>file</literal> back end is often local to a controller
                node, it is not typically suitable for a multi-node glance deployment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For information on requirements for other back ends, see
                <reference name="Configuration Reference" refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/image.html">Configuration Reference</reference>.</paragraph>
        </important>
        <paragraph>The OpenStack Image service is central to Infrastructure-as-a-Service
            (IaaS). It accepts API requests for disk or server images, and
            metadata definitions from end users or OpenStack Compute
            components. It also supports the storage of disk or server images on
            various repository types, including OpenStack Object Storage.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A number of periodic processes run on the OpenStack Image service to
            support caching. Replication services ensure consistency and
            availability through the cluster. Other periodic processes include
            auditors, updaters, and reapers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The OpenStack Image service includes the following components:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Stores, processes, and retrieves metadata about images. Metadata
                        includes items such as size and type.</paragraph>
                    <warning>
                        <paragraph>The registry is a private internal service meant for use by
                            OpenStack Image service. Do not expose this service to users.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Stores image metadata and you can choose your database depending on
                        your preference. Most deployments use MySQL or SQLite.</paragraph>

                <definition>
                    <paragraph>Various repository types are supported including normal file
                        systems (or any filesystem mounted on the glance-api controller
                        node), Object Storage, RADOS block devices, VMware datastore,
                        and HTTP. Note that some repositories will only support read-only
                        usage.</paragraph>

                <definition>
                    <paragraph>A common API for vendors, admins, services, and users to meaningfully
                        define their own custom metadata. This metadata can be used on
                        different types of resources like images, artifacts, volumes,
                        flavors, and aggregates. A definition includes the new propertyâ€™s key,
                        description, constraints, and the resource types which it can be
                        associated with.</paragraph>
