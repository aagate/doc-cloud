            <paragraph>This page describes one way to perform a rolling upgrade from Newton to Ocata
                for a particular configuration of Glance services.  There may be other ways to
                perform a rolling upgrade from Newton to Ocata for other configurations of
                Glance services, but those are beyond the scope of this document.  For the
                experimental rollout of rolling upgrades, we describe only the following
                simple case.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Choose an arbitrary Glance node or provision a new node to install the new
                        release. If an existing Glance node is chosen, gracefully stop the Glance
                        services.  In what follows, this node will be referred to as the NEW NODE.</paragraph>

                <paragraph><strong>Gracefully stopping services</strong></paragraph>
                <paragraph>Before stopping the Glance processes on a node, one may choose to wait until
                    all the existing connections drain out. This could be achieved by taking the
                    node out of rotation, that is, by ensuring that requests are no longer
                    routed to that node. This way all the requests that are currently being
                    processed will get a chance to finish processing.  However, some Glance
                    requests like uploading and downloading images may last a long time. This
                    increases the wait time to drain out all connections and consequently the
                    time to upgrade Glance completely.  On the other hand, stopping the Glance
                    services before the connections drain out will present the user with errors.
                    While arguably this is not downtime given that Images API requests are
                    continually being serviced by other nodes, this is nonetheless an unpleasant
                    user experience for the user whose in-flight request has terminated in an
                    error.  Hence, an operator must be judicious when stopping the services.</paragraph>
