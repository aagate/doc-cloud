        <title>Rate Limiting</title>
        <paragraph>Rate limiting in Swift is implemented as a pluggable middleware.  Rate
            limiting is performed on requests that result in database writes to the
            account and container sqlite dbs.  It uses memcached and is dependent on
            the proxy servers having highly synchronized time.  The rate limits are
            limited by the accuracy of the proxy server clocks.</paragraph>

            <title>Configuration</title>
            <paragraph>All configuration is optional.  If no account or container limits are provided
                there will be no rate limiting.  Configuration available:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The above ratelimiting is to prevent the “many writes to a single container”
                bottleneck from causing a problem. There could also be a problem where a single
                account is just using too much of the cluster’s resources.  In this case, the
                container ratelimits may not help because the customer could be doing thousands
                of reqs/sec to distributed containers each getting a small fraction of the
                total so those limits would never trigger. If a system administrator notices
                this, he/she can set the X-Account-Sysmeta-Global-Write-Ratelimit on an account
                and that will limit the total number of write requests (PUT, POST, DELETE,
                COPY) that account can do for the whole account. This limit will be in addition
                to the applicable account/container limits from above. This header will be
                hidden from the user, because of the gatekeeper middleware, and can only be set
                using a direct client to the account nodes. It accepts a float value and will
                only limit requests if the value is &gt; 0.</paragraph>
