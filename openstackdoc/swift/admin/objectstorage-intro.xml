        <title>Introduction to Object Storage</title>
        <paragraph>OpenStack Object Storage (swift) is used for redundant, scalable data
            storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
            accessible data. It is a long-term storage system for large amounts of
            static data which can be retrieved and updated. Object Storage uses a
            distributed architecture
            with no central point of control, providing greater scalability,
            redundancy, and permanence. Objects are written to multiple hardware
            devices, with the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data
            replication and integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters scale
            horizontally by adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to
            replicate its content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses
            software logic to ensure data replication and distribution across
            different devices, inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be
            used in lieu of more expensive equipment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Object Storage is ideal for cost effective, scale-out storage. It
            provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can
            be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving,
            and data retention.</paragraph>
