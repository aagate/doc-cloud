        <paragraph>For Object Storage, everything is logged in <literal>/var/log/syslog</literal> (or
            <literal>messages</literal> on some distros). Several settings enable further
            customization of logging, such as <literal>log_name</literal>, <literal>log_facility</literal>, and
            <literal>log_level</literal>, within the object server configuration files.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>In the event that a drive has failed, the first step is to make sure the
                    drive is unmounted. This will make it easier for Object Storage to work
                    around the failure until it has been resolved. If the drive is going to
                    be replaced immediately, then it is just best to replace the drive,
                    format it, remount it, and let replication fill it up.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you cannot replace the drive immediately, then it is best to leave it
                    unmounted, and remove the drive from the ring. This will allow all the
                    replicas that were on that drive to be replicated elsewhere until the
                    drive is replaced. Once the drive is replaced, it can be re-added to the
                    ring.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You can look at error messages in the <literal>/var/log/kern.log</literal> file for
                    hints of drive failure.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>If a server is having hardware issues, it is a good idea to make sure
                    the Object Storage services are not running. This will allow Object
                    Storage to work around the failure while you troubleshoot.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If the server just needs a reboot, or a small amount of work that should
                    only last a couple of hours, then it is probably best to let Object
                    Storage work around the failure and get the machine fixed and back
                    online. When the machine comes back online, replication will make sure
                    that anything that is missing during the downtime will get updated.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If the server has more serious issues, then it is probably best to
                    remove all of the server’s devices from the ring. Once the server has
                    been repaired and is back online, the server’s devices can be added back
                    into the ring. It is important that the devices are reformatted before
                    putting them back into the ring as it is likely to be responsible for a
                    different set of partitions than before.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>It has been our experience that when a drive is about to fail, error
                    messages appear in the <literal>/var/log/kern.log</literal> file. There is a script called
                    <literal>swift-drive-audit</literal> that can be run via cron to watch for bad drives. If
                    errors are detected, it will unmount the bad drive, so that Object
                    Storage can work around it. The script takes a configuration file with
                    the following settings:</paragraph>
