            <title>History and Theory of Operation</title>
            <paragraph>There’s a lot of good material out there on Erasure Code (EC) theory, this short
                introduction is just meant to provide some basic context to help the reader
                better understand the implementation in Swift.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Erasure Coding for storage applications grew out of Coding Theory as far back as
                the 1960s with the Reed-Solomon codes.  These codes have been used for years in
                applications ranging from CDs to DVDs to general communications and, yes, even
                in the space program starting with Voyager! The basic idea is that some amount
                of data is broken up into smaller pieces called fragments and coded in such a
                way that it can be transmitted with the ability to tolerate the loss of some
                number of the coded fragments.  That’s where the word “erasure” comes in, if you
                transmit 14 fragments and only 13 are received then one of them is said to be
                “erased”.  The word “erasure” provides an important distinction with EC; it
                isn’t about detecting errors, it’s about dealing with failures.  Another
                important element of EC is that the number of erasures that can be tolerated can
                be adjusted to meet the needs of the application.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>At a high level EC works by using a specific scheme to break up a single data
                buffer into several smaller data buffers then, depending on the scheme,
                performing some encoding operation on that data in order to generate additional
                information.  So you end up with more data than you started with and that extra
                data is often called “parity”.  Note that there are many, many different
                encoding techniques that vary both in how they organize and manipulate the data
                as well by what means they use to calculate parity.  For example, one scheme
                might rely on <reference name="Galois Field Arithmetic" refuri="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/Papers/plank-fast13.pdf">Galois Field Arithmetic</reference><target ids="galois-field-arithmetic" names="galois\ field\ arithmetic" refuri="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/Papers/plank-fast13.pdf"></target> while others may work with only XOR. The number of variations and
                details about their differences are well beyond the scope of this introduction,
                but we will talk more about a few of them when we get into the implementation of
                EC in Swift.</paragraph>

                <title>Overview of EC Support in Swift</title>
                <paragraph>First and foremost, from an application perspective EC support is totally
                    transparent. There are no EC related external API; a container is simply created
                    using a Storage Policy defined to use EC and then interaction with the cluster
                    is the same as any other durability policy.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>EC is implemented in Swift as a Storage Policy, see <reference internal="True" refuri="overview_policies"><inline classes="doc">Storage Policies</inline></reference> for
                    complete details on Storage Policies.  Because support is implemented as a
                    Storage Policy, all of the storage devices associated with your cluster’s EC
                    capability can be isolated.  It is entirely possible to share devices between
                    storage policies, but for EC it may make more sense to not only use separate
                    devices but possibly even entire nodes dedicated for EC.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Which direction one chooses depends on why the EC policy is being deployed.  If,
                    for example, there is a production replication policy in place already and the
                    goal is to add a cold storage tier such that the existing nodes performing
                    replication are impacted as little as possible, adding a new set of nodes
                    dedicated to EC might make the most sense but also incurs the most cost.  On the
                    other hand, if EC is being added as a capability to provide additional
                    durability for a specific set of applications and the existing infrastructure is
                    well suited for EC (sufficient number of nodes, zones for the EC scheme that is
                    chosen) then leveraging the existing infrastructure such that the EC ring shares
                    nodes with the replication ring makes the most sense.  These are some of the
                    main considerations:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The Swift code base does not include any of the algorithms necessary to perform
                    the actual encoding and decoding of data; that is left to external libraries.
                    The Storage Policies architecture is leveraged to enable EC on a per container
                    basis – the object rings are still used to determine the placement of EC data
                    fragments. Although there are several code paths that are unique to an operation
                    associated with an EC policy, an external dependency to an Erasure Code library
                    is what Swift counts on to perform the low level EC functions.  The use of an
                    external library allows for maximum flexibility as there are a significant
                    number of options out there, each with its owns pros and cons that can vary
                    greatly from one use case to another.</paragraph>

                    configurations may vary in performance per algorithm).  More on this will be

                <paragraph>In EC policies, similarly to replication, handoff nodes are a set of storage
                    nodes used to augment the list of primary nodes responsible for storing an
                    erasure coded object. These handoff nodes are used in the event that one or more
                    of the primaries are unavailable.  Handoff nodes are still selected with an
                    attempt to achieve maximum separation of the data being placed.</paragraph>

                <title>Reconstruction</title>
                <paragraph>For an EC policy, reconstruction is analogous to the process of replication for
                    a replication type policy – essentially “the reconstructor” replaces “the
                    replicator” for EC policy types. The basic framework of reconstruction is very
                    similar to that of replication with a few notable exceptions:</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Because EC does not actually replicate partitions, it needs to operate at a
                            finer granularity than what is provided with rsync, therefore EC leverages
                            much of ssync behind the scenes (you do not need to manually configure ssync).</paragraph>

                            reconstructor has to read in enough surviving fragments from other nodes and
                            perform a local reconstruction before it has the correct data to push to the
                            other node.</paragraph>

                            responsible for an EC partition, this would be far too chatty, instead each
                            reconstructor is responsible for sync’ing with the partition’s closest two
                            neighbors (closest meaning left and right on the ring).</paragraph>

                        operations, as well as on the storage nodes for reconstruction.  As with
                        replication, reconstruction can be the result of rebalancing, bit-rot, drive
                        failure or reverting data from a hand-off node back to its primary.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>When PyECLib encodes an object, it will break it into N fragments. However, what
                is important during configuration, is how many of those are data and how many
                are parity.  So in the example above, PyECLib will actually break an object in
                14 different fragments, 10 of them will be made up of actual object data and 4
                of them will be made of parity data (calculations depending on ec_type).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When deciding which devices to use in the EC policy’s object ring, be sure to
                carefully consider the performance impacts.  Running some performance
                benchmarking in a test environment for your configuration is highly recommended
                before deployment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To create the EC policy’s object ring, the only difference in the usage of the
                <literal>swift-ring-builder create</literal> command is the <literal>replicas</literal> parameter.  The
                <literal>replicas</literal> value is the number of fragments spread across the object servers
                associated with the ring; <literal>replicas</literal> must be equal to the sum of
                <literal>ec_num_data_fragments</literal> and <literal>ec_num_parity_fragments</literal>. For example:</paragraph>
            <literal_block xml:space="preserve">swift-ring-builder object-1.builder create 10 14 1</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Note that in this example the <literal>replicas</literal> value of <literal>14</literal> is based on the sum of
                <literal>10</literal> EC data fragments and <literal>4</literal> EC parity fragments.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Once you have configured your EC policy in <title_reference>swift.conf</title_reference> and created your object
                ring, your application is ready to start using EC simply by creating a container
                with the specified policy name and interacting as usual.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>It’s important to note that once you have deployed a policy and have created
                    objects with that policy, these configurations options cannot be changed. In
                    case a change in the configuration is desired, you must create a new policy
                    and migrate the data to a new container.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>EC Duplication enables Swift to make duplicated copies of fragments of erasure
                    coded objects.  If an EC storage policy is configured with a non-default
                    <literal>ec_duplication_factor</literal> of <literal>N &gt; 1</literal>, then the policy will create <literal>N</literal>
                    duplicates of each unique fragment that is returned from the configured EC
                    engine.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Duplication of EC fragments is optimal for Global EC storage policies, which
                    require dispersion of fragment data across failure domains. Without fragment
                    duplication, common EC parameters will not distribute enough unique fragments
                    between large failure domains to allow for a rebuild using fragments from any
                    one domain.  For example a uniformly distributed <literal>10+4</literal> EC policy schema
                    would place 7 fragments in each of two failure domains, which is less in each
                    failure domain than the 10 fragments needed to rebuild a missing fragment.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Without fragment duplication, an EC policy schema must be adjusted to include
                    additional parity fragments in order to guarantee the number of fragments in
                    each failure domain is greater than the number required to rebuild. For
                    example, a uniformly distributed <literal>10+18</literal> EC policy schema would place 14
                    fragments in each of two failure domains, which is more than sufficient in each
                    failure domain to rebuild a missing fragment. However, empirical testing has
                    shown encoding a schema with <literal>num_parity &gt; num_data</literal> (such as <literal>10+18</literal>) is
                    less efficient than using duplication of fragments.  EC fragment duplication
                    enables Swift’s Global EC to maintain more independence between failure domains

                    <paragraph>Conversely, a conventional ring spanning the two regions may give a suboptimal

                    <paragraph>Proxy servers require a set of <emphasis>unique</emphasis> fragment indexes to decode the original
                        object when handling a GET request to an EC policy. With a conventional EC
                        policy, this is very likely to be the outcome of reading fragments from a
                        random selection of backend nodes. With an EC Duplication policy it is
                        significantly more likely that responses from a <emphasis>random</emphasis> selection of backend
                        nodes might include some duplicated fragments.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>For this reason it is strongly recommended that EC Duplication always be
                        deployed in combination with <reference internal="True" refuri="overview_ring#composite-rings"><inline classes="std std-ref">Composite Rings</inline></reference> and <reference internal="True" refuri="overview_global_cluster#configuring-global-clusters"><inline classes="std std-ref">proxy server read

                    <paragraph>Under normal conditions with the recommended deployment, read affinity will
                        cause a proxy server to first attempt to read fragments from nodes in its local
                        region. These fragments are guaranteed to be unique with respect to each other.
                        Even if there are a small number of local failures, unique local parity
                        fragments will make up the difference.  However, should enough local primary
                        storage nodes fail, such that sufficient unique fragments are not available in
                        the local region, a global EC cluster will proceed to read fragments from the
                        other region(s). Random reads from the remote region are not guaranteed to
                        return unique fragments; with EC Duplication there is a significantly high
                        probability that the proxy sever will encounter a fragment that is a duplicate
                        of one it has already found in the local region. The proxy server will ignore
                        these and make additional requests until it accumulates the required set of
                        unique fragments, potentially searching all the primary and handoff locations
                        in the local and remote regions before ultimately failing the read.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>A global EC deployment configured as recommended is therefore extremely
                        resilient. However, under extreme failure conditions read handling can be
                        inefficient because nodes in other regions are guaranteed to have some
                        fragments which are duplicates of those the proxy server has already received.
                        Work is in progress to improve the proxy server node selection strategy such
                        that when it is necessary to read from other regions, nodes that are likely to
                        have useful fragments are preferred over those that are likely to return a

                    directory information.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In addition to the object timestamp, the filenames of EC archives encode other
                    information related to the archive:</paragraph>
                <bullet_list bullet="*">
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>The fragment archive index. This is required for a few reasons. For one, it
                            allows us to store fragment archives of different indexes on the same storage
                            node which is not typical however it is possible in many circumstances.
                            Without unique filenames for the different EC archive files in a set, we
                            would be at risk of overwriting one archive of index <title_reference>n</title_reference> with another of
                            index <title_reference>m</title_reference> in some scenarios.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The index is appended to the filename just before the <literal>.data</literal> extension.
                            For example, the filename for a fragment archive storing the 5th fragment
                            would be:</paragraph>
                        <literal_block xml:space="preserve">1418673556.92690#5.data</literal_block>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>The durable state of the archive. The meaning of this will be described in
                            more detail later, but a fragment archive that is considered durable has an
                            additional <literal>#d</literal> string included in its filename immediately before the
                            <literal>.data</literal> extension. For example:</paragraph>
                        <literal_block xml:space="preserve">1418673556.92690#5#d.data</literal_block>
                    </list_item>
                </bullet_list>
                <paragraph>A policy-specific transformation function is therefore used to build the
                    archive filename. These functions are implemented in the diskfile module as
                    methods of policy specific sub classes of <literal>BaseDiskFileManager</literal>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The transformation function for the replication policy is simply a NOP.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>In older versions the durable state of an archive was represented by an
                        additional file called the <literal>.durable</literal> file instead of the <literal>#d</literal>
                        substring in the <literal>.data</literal> filename. The <literal>.durable</literal> for the example above
                        would be:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>MIME supports a conversation between the proxy and the storage nodes for every

                        assure that we have the essence of a 2 phase commit, basically having the proxy
                        communicate back to the storage nodes once it has confirmation that a quorum of
                        fragment archives in the set have been written.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>For the first phase of the conversation the proxy requires a quorum of
                        <title_reference>ec_ndata + 1</title_reference> fragment archives to be successfully put to storage nodes. This
                        ensures that the object could still be reconstructed even if one of the
                        fragment archives becomes unavailable. As described above, each fragment
                        archive file is named:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">&lt;ts&gt;#&lt;frag_index&gt;.data</literal_block>
                    <paragraph>where <literal>ts</literal> is the timestamp and <literal>frag_index</literal> is the fragment archive index.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>During the second phase of the conversation the proxy communicates a
                        confirmation to storage nodes that the fragment archive quorum has been
                        achieved. This causes each storage node to rename the fragment archive written
                        in the first phase of the conversation to include the substring <literal>#d</literal> in its
                        name:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>This indicates to the object server that this fragment archive is <title_reference>durable</title_reference> and

                    <paragraph>For the second phase of the conversation the proxy requires a quorum of
                        <title_reference>ec_ndata + 1</title_reference> successful commits on storage nodes. This ensures that there are
                        sufficient committed fragment archives for the object to be reconstructed even
                        if one becomes unavailable. The reconstructor ensures that the durable state is
                        replicated on storage nodes where it may be missing.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Note that the completion of the commit phase of the conversation
                        is also a signal for the object server to go ahead and immediately delete older
                        timestamp files for this object. This is critical as we do not want to delete
                        the older object until the storage node has confirmation from the proxy, via the
                        multi-phase conversation, that the other nodes have landed enough for a quorum.</paragraph>

                    <title>Partial PUT Failures</title>
                    <paragraph>A partial PUT failure has a few different modes.  In one scenario the Proxy
                        Server is alive through the entire PUT conversation.  This is a very
                        straightforward case. The client will receive a good response if and only if a
                        quorum of fragment archives were successfully landed on their storage nodes.
                        In this case the Reconstructor will discover the missing fragment archives,
                        perform a reconstruction and deliver those fragment archives to their nodes.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The more interesting case is what happens if the proxy dies in the middle of a
                        conversation.  If it turns out that a quorum had been met and the commit phase
                        of the conversation finished, its as simple as the previous case in that the
                        reconstructor will repair things.  However, if the commit didn’t get a chance to
                        happen then some number of the storage nodes have .data files on them (fragment
                        archives) but none of them knows whether there are enough elsewhere for the
                        entire object to be reconstructed.  In this case the client will not have
                        received a 2xx response so there is no issue there, however, it is left to the
                        storage nodes to clean up the stale fragment archives.  Work is ongoing in this
                        area to enable the proxy to play a role in reviving these fragment archives,
                        however, for the current release, a proxy failure after the start of a
                        conversation but before the commit message will simply result in a PUT failure.</paragraph>

                        EC archives returned from other object servers. This means that the proxy can
                        successfully GET an object that had missing durable state on some nodes when it
                        was PUT (i.e. a partial PUT failure occurred).</paragraph>

                        cause the proxy server to issue multiple requests for distinct EC archives to
                        that object server. (This situation can temporarily occur after a ring
                        rebalance when a handoff node storing an archive has become a primary node and
                        received its primary archive but not yet moved the handoff archive to its

                        ensures that it has sufficient EC archives with the same timestamp
                        and distinct fragment indexes before considering a GET to be successful.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>However, under the hood it operates quite differently.  The following are some
                    of the key elements in understanding how the reconstructor operates.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Unlike the replicator, the work that the reconstructor does is not always as
                    easy to break down into the 2 basic tasks of synchronize or revert (move data
                    from handoff back to primary) because of the fact that one storage node can
                    house fragment archives of various indexes and each index really “belongs” to
                    a different node.  So, whereas when the replicator is reverting data from a
                    handoff it has just one node to send its data to, the reconstructor can have
                    several.  Additionally, it is not always the case that the processing of a
                    particular suffix directory means one or the other job type for the entire
                    directory (as it does for replication). The scenarios that create these mixed
                    situations can be pretty complex so we will just focus on what the
                    reconstructor does here and not a detailed explanation of why.</paragraph>

                    <title>Job Construction and Processing</title>
                    <paragraph>Because of the nature of the work it has to do as described above, the
                        reconstructor builds jobs for a single job processor.  The job itself contains
                        all of the information needed for the processor to execute the job which may be
                        a synchronization or a data reversion.  There may be a mix of jobs that
                        perform both of these operations on the same suffix directory.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Jobs are constructed on a per-partition basis and then per-fragment-index basis.
                        That is, there will be one job for every fragment index in a partition.
                        Performing this construction “up front” like this helps minimize the
                        interaction between nodes collecting hashes.pkl information.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Once a set of jobs for a partition has been constructed, those jobs are sent off
                        to threads for execution. The single job processor then performs the necessary
                        actions, working closely with ssync to carry out its instructions.  For data
                        reversion, the actual objects themselves are cleaned up via the ssync module and
                        once that partition’s set of jobs is complete, the reconstructor will attempt to
                        remove the relevant directory structures.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Job construction must account for a variety of scenarios, including:</paragraph>

                        in the middle. The reconstructor is hard-wired to use ssync to determine what is
                        missing and desired by the other side. However, before an object is sent over
                        the wire it needs to be reconstructed from the remaining fragments as the local
                        fragment is just that - a different fragment index than what the other end is

                    <paragraph>The reader in this class gathers fragments from the nodes and uses PyECLib to
                        reconstruct each segment before yielding data back to ssync. Essentially what
                        this means is that data is buffered, in memory, on a per segment basis at the
                        node performing reconstruction and each segment is dynamically reconstructed and
                        delivered to <literal>ssync_sender</literal> where the <literal>send_put()</literal> method will ship them on
                        over.  The sender is then responsible for deleting the objects as they are sent
                        in the case of data reversion.</paragraph>

                <title>The Auditor</title>
                <paragraph>Because the auditor already operates on a per storage policy basis, there are no
                    specific auditor changes associated with EC.  Each EC archive looks like, and is
                    treated like, a regular object from the perspective of the auditor.  Therefore,
                    if the auditor finds bit-rot in an EC archive, it simply quarantines it and the
                    reconstructor will take care of the rest just as the replicator does for
                    replication policies.</paragraph>
