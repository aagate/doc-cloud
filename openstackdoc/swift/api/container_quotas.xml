        <title>Container quotas</title>
        <paragraph>You can set quotas on the size and number of objects stored in a
            container by setting the following metadata:</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="-">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><literal>X-Container-Meta-Quota-Bytes</literal>. The size, in bytes, of objects that
                    can be stored in a container.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><literal>X-Container-Meta-Quota-Count</literal>. The number of objects that can be
                    stored in a container.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
        </bullet_list>
        <paragraph>When you exceed a container quota, subsequent requests to create objects
            fail with a 413 Request Entity Too Large error.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Object Storage system uses an eventual consistency model. When you
            create a new object, the container size and object count might not be
            immediately updated. Consequently, you might be allowed to create
            objects even though you have actually exceeded the quota.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>At some later time, the system updates the container size and object
            count to the actual values. At this time, subsequent requests fails. In
            addition, if you are currently under the
            <literal>X-Container-Meta-Quota-Bytes</literal> limit and a request uses chunked
            transfer encoding, the system cannot know if the request will exceed the
            quota so the system allows the request. However, once the quota is
            exceeded, any subsequent uploads that use chunked transfer encoding
            fail.</paragraph>
