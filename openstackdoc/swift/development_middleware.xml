                the request and response of a Python WSGI application (i.e. a webapp,
                or REST/HTTP API), like Swift’s WSGI servers (proxy-server,
                account-server, container-server, object-server).  Swift uses middleware
                to add (sometimes optional) behaviors to the Swift WSGI servers.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Middleware can be added to the Swift WSGI servers by modifying their
                <reference name="paste" refuri="http://pythonpaste.org/">paste</reference> configuration file.  The majority of Swift middleware is applied
                to the <reference internal="True" refuri="proxy#proxy-server"><inline classes="std std-ref">Proxy Server</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
            <target ids="paste" names="paste" refuri="http://pythonpaste.org/"></target>
            <paragraph>Given the following basic configuration:</paragraph>
            <literal_block xml:space="preserve">[DEFAULT]
log_level = DEBUG
user = &lt;your-user-name&gt;

[pipeline:main]
pipeline = proxy-server

[app:proxy-server]
use = egg:swift#proxy</literal_block>
            <paragraph>You could add the <reference internal="True" refuri="middleware#healthcheck"><inline classes="std std-ref">Healthcheck</inline></reference> middleware by adding a section for
                that filter and adding it to the pipeline:</paragraph>
            <literal_block xml:space="preserve">[DEFAULT]
log_level = DEBUG
user = &lt;your-user-name&gt;

[pipeline:main]
pipeline = healthcheck proxy-server

[filter:healthcheck]
use = egg:swift#healthcheck

[app:proxy-server]
use = egg:swift#proxy</literal_block>
            <paragraph>Some middleware is required and will be inserted into your pipeline
                automatically by core swift code (e.g. the proxy-server will insert
                <reference internal="True" refuri="middleware#catch-errors"><inline classes="std std-ref">CatchErrors</inline></reference> and <reference internal="True" refuri="middleware#gatekeeper"><inline classes="std std-ref">GateKeeper</inline></reference> at the start of the pipeline if they
                are not already present).  You can see which features are available on a given
                Swift endpoint (including middleware) using the <reference internal="True" refuri="middleware#discoverability"><inline classes="std std-ref">Discoverability</inline></reference>
                interface.</paragraph>

            <title>Swift Metadata</title>
            <paragraph>Generally speaking metadata is information about a resource that is
                associated with the resource but is not the data contained in the
                resource itself - which is set and retrieved via HTTP headers. (e.g. the
                “Content-Type” of a Swift object that is returned in HTTP response
                headers)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>All user resources in Swift (i.e. account, container, objects) can have
                user metadata associated with them.  Middleware may also persist custom
                metadata to accounts and containers safely using System Metadata.  Some
                core Swift features which predate sysmeta have added exceptions for
                custom non-user metadata headers (e.g.  <reference internal="True" refuri="misc#acls"><inline classes="std std-ref">ACLs</inline></reference>,
                <reference internal="True" refuri="overview_large_objects#large-objects"><inline classes="std std-ref">Large Object Support</inline></reference>)</paragraph>

                <paragraph>User metadata takes the form of <literal>X-&lt;type&gt;-Meta-&lt;key&gt;: &lt;value&gt;</literal>, where
                    <literal>&lt;type&gt;</literal> depends on the resources type (i.e. Account, Container, Object)
                    and <literal>&lt;key&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;value&gt;</literal> are set by the client.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>User metadata should generally be reserved for use by the client or
                    client applications.  A perfect example use-case for user metadata is
                    <reference name="python-swiftclient" refuri="https://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient">python-swiftclient</reference>’s <literal>X-Object-Meta-Mtime</literal> which it stores on

                <paragraph>New middleware should avoid storing metadata within the User Metadata
                    namespace to avoid potential conflict with existing user metadata when
                    introducing new metadata keys.  An example of legacy middleware that
                    borrows the user metadata namespace is <reference internal="True" refuri="middleware#tempurl"><inline classes="std std-ref">TempURL</inline></reference>.  An example of
                    middleware which uses custom non-user metadata to avoid the user
                    metadata namespace is <reference internal="True" refuri="overview_large_objects#slo-doc"><inline classes="std std-ref">Static Large Objects</inline></reference>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>User metadata that is stored by a PUT or POST request to a container or account
                    resource persists until it is explicitly removed by a subsequent PUT or POST
                    request that includes a header <literal>X-&lt;type&gt;-Meta-&lt;key&gt;</literal> with no value or a
                    header <literal>X-Remove-&lt;type&gt;-Meta-&lt;key&gt;: &lt;ignored-value&gt;</literal>. In the latter case the
                    <literal>&lt;ignored-value&gt;</literal> is not stored. All user metadata stored with an account or

                <paragraph>User metadata that is stored with an object resource has a different semantic;
                    object user metadata persists until any subsequent PUT or POST request is made
                    to the same object, at which point all user metadata stored with that object is
                    deleted en-masse and replaced with any user metadata included with the PUT or
                    POST request. As a result, it is not possible to update a subset of the user
                    metadata items stored with an object while leaving some items unchanged.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>System metadata provides a means to store potentially private custom
                    metadata with associated Swift resources in a safe and secure fashion
                    without actually having to plumb custom metadata through the core swift
                    servers.  The incoming filtering ensures that the namespace can not be
                    modified directly by client requests, and the outgoing filter ensures
                    that removing middleware that uses a specific system metadata key
                    renders it benign.  New middleware should take advantage of system
                    metadata.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>System metadata may be set on accounts and containers by including headers with
                    a PUT or POST request. Where a header name matches the name of an existing item
                    of system metadata, the value of the existing item will be updated. Otherwise
                    existing items are preserved. A system metadata header with an empty value will
                    cause any existing item with the same name to be deleted.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>System metadata may be set on objects using only PUT requests. All items of
                    existing system metadata will be deleted and replaced en-masse by any system
                    metadata headers included with the PUT request. System metadata is neither
                    updated nor deleted by a POST request: updating individual items of system
                    metadata with a POST request is not yet supported in the same way that updating
                    individual items of user metadata is not supported. In cases where middleware
                    needs to store its own metadata with a POST request, it may use Object Transient
                    Sysmeta.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Transient-sysmeta updates on an object have the same semantic as user
                    metadata updates on an object (see <reference internal="True" refid="usermeta"><inline classes="std std-ref">User Metadata</inline></reference>) i.e. whenever any PUT or

                    deleted en-masse and replaced with any transient-sysmeta included with the PUT
                    or POST request. Transient-sysmeta set by a middleware is therefore prone to
                    deletion by a subsequent client-generated POST request unless the middleware is
                    careful to include its transient-sysmeta with every POST. Likewise, user
                    metadata set by a client is prone to deletion by a subsequent
                    middleware-generated POST request, and for that reason middleware should avoid
                    generating POST requests that are independent of any client request.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Transient-sysmeta deliberately uses a different header prefix to user metadata
                    so that middlewares can avoid potential conflict with user metadata keys.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Transient-sysmeta deliberately uses a different header prefix to system
                    metadata to emphasize the fact that the data is only persisted until a
                    subsequent POST.</paragraph>
