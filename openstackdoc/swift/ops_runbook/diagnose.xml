            <title>Functional tests usage</title>
            <paragraph>We would recommend that you set up the functional tests to run against your
                production system. Run regularly this can be a useful tool to validate
                that the system is configured correctly. In addition, it can provide
                early warning about failures in your system (if the functional tests stop
                working, user applications will also probably stop working).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A script for running the function tests is located in <literal>swift/.functests</literal>.</paragraph>

                    System level issues should be resolved prior to diagnosis of swift

            <paragraph>The swift-dispersion-report is a useful tool to gauge the general
                health of the system. Configure the <literal>swift-dispersion</literal> report to cover at
                a minimum every disk drive in your system (usually 1% coverage).
                See <reference internal="True" refuri="../admin_guide#dispersion-report"><inline classes="std std-ref">Dispersion Report</inline></reference> for details of how to configure and
                use the dispersion reporting tool.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The <literal>swift-dispersion-report</literal> tool can take a long time to run, especially
                if any servers are down. We suggest you run it regularly
                (e.g., in a cron job) and save the results. This makes it easy to refer
                to the last report without having to wait for a long-running command
                to complete.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Look at the <literal>Wait</literal> and <literal>SvcTime</literal> values. It is not normal for
                these values to exceed 50msec. This is known to impact customer
                performance (upload/download). For a controller problem, many/all drives
                will show long wait and service times. A reboot may correct the problem;
                otherwise hardware replacement is needed.</paragraph>

            <title>Diagnose: Slow network link - Measuring network performance</title>
            <paragraph>Network faults can cause performance between Swift nodes to degrade. Testing
                with <literal>netperf</literal> is recommended. Other methods (such as copying large
                files) may also work, but can produce inconclusive results.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Install <literal>netperf</literal> on all systems if not
                already installed. Check that the UFW rules for its control port are in place.
                However, there are no pre-opened ports for netperf’s data connection. Pick a
                port number. In this example, 12866 is used because it is one higher
                than netperf’s default control port number, 12865. If you get very
                strange results including zero values, you may not have gotten the data
                port opened in UFW at the target or may have gotten the netperf
                command-line wrong.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Pick a <literal>source</literal> and <literal>target</literal> node. The source is often a proxy node
                and the target is often an object node. Using the same source proxy you
                can test communication to different object nodes in different AZs to
                identity possible bottlenecks.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Nic module drivers can be re-initialised by carefully removing and
                re-installing the modules (this avoids rebooting the server).
                For example, mellanox drivers use a two part driver mlx4_en and
                mlx4_core. To reload these you must carefully remove the mlx4_en
                (ethernet) then the mlx4_core modules, and reinstall them in the
                reverse order.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As the interface will be disabled while the modules are unloaded, you
                must be very careful not to lock yourself out so it may be better
                to script this.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>A replicator reports in its log that remaining time exceeds
                100 hours. This may indicate that the swift <literal>object-replicator</literal> is stuck and not

            <paragraph>The above status is output every 5 minutes to <literal>/var/log/swift/background.log</literal>.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>The ‘remaining’ time is increasing as time goes on, normally the
                    time remaining should be decreasing. Also note the partition number. For example,
                    15344 remains the same for several status lines. Eventually the object
                    replicator detects the hang and attempts to make progress by killing the
                    problem thread. The replicator then progresses to the next partition but
                    quite often it again gets stuck on the same partition.</paragraph>
