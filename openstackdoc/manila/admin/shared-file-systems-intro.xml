        <paragraph>Shared File Systems service provides a set of services for management of
            shared file systems in a multi-project cloud environment. The service resembles
            OpenStack block-based storage management from the OpenStack Block Storage
            service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can
            create a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then
            read and write data from your instances to and from your file system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Shared File Systems service serves same purpose as the Amazon Elastic File
            System (EFS) does.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Shared File Systems service can run in a single-node or multiple
            node configuration.  The Shared File Systems service can be configured
            to provision shares from one or more back ends, so it is required to
            declare at least one back end. Shared File System service contains
            several configurable components.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is important to understand these components:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Shared File Systems service consists of four types of services,
            most of which are similar to those of the Block Storage service:</paragraph>

            deployment.</paragraph>
