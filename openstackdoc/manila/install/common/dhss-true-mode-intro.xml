        <title>Shared File Systems Option 2: Driver support for share servers management</title>
        <paragraph>For simplicity, this configuration references the same storage node
            as the one used for the Block Storage service.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>This guide describes how to configure the Shared File Systems service to
                use the <literal>generic</literal> driver with the driver handles share server mode
                (DHSS) enabled. This driver requires Compute service (nova), Image service
                (glance) and Networking service (neutron) for creating and managing share
                servers; and Block storage service (cinder) for creating shares. The
                information used for creating share servers is configured as share
                networks. Generic driver with DHSS enabled also requires the tenantâ€™s
                private network (where the compute instances are running) to be attached
                to a public router.</paragraph>
