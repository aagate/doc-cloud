        <title>Setting Container Driver Up Manually</title>
        <paragraph>This section describes steps needed to be performed to set the driver up
            manually. The driver has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, thus in case of
            any other distribution package names might differ.
            The following packages must be installed:</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="-">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>docker.io</paragraph>
            </list_item>
        </bullet_list>
        <paragraph>One can verify if the package is installed by issuing <literal>sudo docker info</literal>
            command. In case of normal operation it should return docker usage statistics.
            In case it fails complaining on inaccessible socket try installing
            <literal>apparmor</literal>. Please note that docker usage requires superuser privileges.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After docker is successfully installed a docker image containing necessary
            packages must be provided. Currently such image could be downloaded from
            <reference refuri="https://github.com/a-ovchinnikov/manila-image-elements-lxd-images/releases/download/0.1.0/manila-docker-container.tar.gz">https://github.com/a-ovchinnikov/manila-image-elements-lxd-images/releases/download/0.1.0/manila-docker-container.tar.gz</reference>.
            The image has to be unpacked but not untarred. This could be achieved by
            running ‘gzip -d &lt;imagename&gt;’ command. Resulting tar-archive of the
            image could be uploaded to docker via</paragraph>
        <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="console" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">sudo docker load --input &lt;imagename.tar&gt;</literal_block>
        <paragraph>If the previous command finished successfully you will be able to see the image
            in the image list:</paragraph>
        <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="console" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">sudo docker images</literal_block>
        <paragraph>The driver expects to find a folder /tmp/shares on the host where it is running
            as well as a logical volume group “manila_docker_volumes”.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When installing the driver manually one must make sure that ‘brctl’ and
            ‘docker’ commands are present in the /etc/manila/rootwrap.d/share.filters
            and could be executed as root.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Finally to use the driver one must add a backend to the config file
            containing the following  settings:</paragraph>
        <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="ini" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">driver_handles_share_servers = True
share_driver = manila.share.drivers.container.driver.ContainerShareDriver
neutron_host_id = &lt;hostname&gt;</literal_block>
        <paragraph>where &lt;hostname&gt; is the name of the host running neutron. (In case of single
            VM devstack it is VM’s name).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After restarting manila services you should be able to use the driver.</paragraph>
