        <title>Using Commit Message Tags in Manila</title>
        <paragraph>When writing git commit messages for code submissions into manila, it can be
            useful to provide tags in the message for both human consumption as well as
            linking to other external resources, such as Launchpad. Each tag should be
            placed on a separate line. The following tags are used in manila.</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="-">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>APIImpact</strong> - Use this tag when the code change modifies a public HTTP
                    API interface. This tag indicates that the patch creates, changes, or deletes
                    a public API interface or changes its behavior. The tag may be followed by a
                    reason beginning on the next line. If you are touching manilaâ€™s API layer and
                    you are unsure if your change has an impact on the API, use this tag anyway.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>Change-id</strong> - This tag is automatically generated by a Gerrit hook and is
                    a unique hash that describes the change. This hash should not be changed
                    when rebasing as it is used by Gerrit to keep track of the change.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>Closes-Bug: | Partial-Bug: | Related-Bug:</strong> <emphasis>&lt;#launchpad_bug_id&gt;</emphasis> - These
                    tags are used when the change closes, partially closes, or relates to the bug
                    referenced by the Launchpad bug ID respectively. This will automatically
                    generate a link to the bug in Launchpad for easy access for reviewers.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>DocImpact</strong> - Use this tag when the code change requires changes or
                    updates to documentation in order to be understood. This tag can also be
                    used if the documentation is provided along with the patch itself. This will
                    also generate a Launchpad bug in manila for triaging and tracking.
                    Refer to the section on <reference internal="True" refuri="documenting_your_work#documenting-your-work"><inline classes="std std-ref">Documenting your work</inline></reference> to understand where
                    to add documentation.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>Implements: | Partially Implements:</strong> <emphasis>blueprint &lt;name_of_blueprint&gt;</emphasis> - Use
                    this tag when a change implements or partially implements the given blueprint
                    in Launchpad. This will automatically generate a link to the blueprint in
                    Gerrit for easy access for reviewers.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><strong>TrivialFix</strong> - This tag is used for a trivial issue, such as a typo, an
                    unclear log message, or a simple code refactor that does not change existing
                    behavior which does not require the creation of a separate bug or blueprint
                    in Launchpad.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
        </bullet_list>
        <paragraph>Make sure that the <strong>Closes-Bug</strong>, <strong>Partial-Bug</strong>, <strong>Related-Bug</strong>,
            <strong>blueprint</strong>, and <strong>Change-id</strong> tags are at the very end of the commit
            message. The Gerrit hooks will automatically put the hash at the end of the
            commit message. For more information on tags and some examples of good commit
            messages, refer to the <reference name="GitCommitMessages" refuri="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Including_external_references">GitCommitMessages</reference> documentation.</paragraph>
