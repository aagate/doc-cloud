        <title>AMQP and manila</title>
        <paragraph>AMQP is the messaging technology chosen by the OpenStack cloud.  The AMQP broker, either RabbitMQ or Qpid, sits between any two manila components and allows them to communicate in a loosely coupled fashion. More precisely, manila components (the compute fabric of OpenStack) use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC hereinafter) to communicate to one another; however such a paradigm is built atop the publish/subscribe paradigm so that the following benefits can be achieved:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Manila uses direct, fanout, and topic-based exchanges. The architecture looks like the one depicted in the figure below:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Manila implements RPC (both request+response, and one-way, respectively nicknamed ‘rpc.call’ and ‘rpc.cast’) over AMQP by providing an adapter class which take cares of marshaling and unmarshaling of messages into function calls. Each manila service (for example Compute, Volume, etc.) create two queues at the initialization time, one which accepts messages with routing keys ‘NODE-TYPE.NODE-ID’ (for example compute.hostname) and another, which accepts messages with routing keys as generic ‘NODE-TYPE’ (for example compute). The former is used specifically when Manila-API needs to redirect commands to a specific node like ‘euca-terminate instance’. In this case, only the  compute node whose host’s hypervisor is running the virtual machine can kill the instance. The API acts as a consumer when RPC calls are request/response, otherwise is acts as publisher only.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The figure below shows the internals of a message broker node (referred to as a RabbitMQ node in the diagrams) when a single instance is deployed and shared in an OpenStack cloud. Every manila component connects to the message broker and, depending on its personality (for example a compute node or a network node), may use the queue either as an Invoker (such as API or Scheduler) or a Worker (such as Compute, Volume or Network). Invokers and Workers do not actually exist in the manila object model, but we are going to use them as an abstraction for sake of clarity. An Invoker is a component that sends messages in the queuing system via two operations: 1) rpc.call and ii) rpc.cast; a Worker is a component that receives messages from the queuing system and reply accordingly to rcp.call operations.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Figure 2 shows the following internal elements:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Topic Publisher: A Topic Publisher comes to life when an rpc.call or an rpc.cast operation is executed; this object is instantiated and used to push a message to the queuing system. Every publisher connects always to the same topic-based exchange; its life-cycle is limited to the message delivery.</paragraph>

A Topic Consumer connects to the same topic-based exchange either via a shared queue or via a unique exclusive queue. Every Worker has two topic consumers, one that is addressed only during rpc.cast operations (and it connects to a shared queue whose exchange key is ‘topic’) and the other that is addressed only during rpc.call operations (and it connects to a unique queue whose exchange key is ‘topic.host’).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Routing_key: The interpretation of the routing key depends on the value of the exchange_type attribute.</paragraph>

                                <paragraph>Direct exchange: If the routing key property of the message and the routing_key attribute of the queue are identical, then the message is forwarded to the queue.</paragraph>
                            </list_item>

                                <paragraph>Fanout exchange: messages are forwarded to the queues bound the exchange, even if the binding does not have a key.</paragraph>

                                <paragraph>Topic exchange: If the routing key property of the message matches the routing key of the key according to a primitive pattern matching scheme, then the message is forwarded to the queue. The message routing key then consists of words separated by dots (“.”, like domain names), and two special characters are available; star (“”) and hash (“#”). The star matches any word, and the hash matches zero or more words. For example “.stock.#” matches the routing keys “usd.stock” and “eur.stock.db” but not “stock.nasdaq”.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Durable: This flag determines the durability of both exchanges and queues; durable exchanges and queues remain active when a RabbitMQ server restarts. Non-durable exchanges/queues (transient exchanges/queues) are purged when a server restarts. It is worth noting that AMQP specifies that durable queues cannot bind to transient exchanges. Default is True.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Auto_delete: If set, the exchange is deleted when all queues have finished using it. Default is False.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Exclusive: exclusive queues (such as non-shared) may only be consumed from by the current connection. When exclusive is on, this also implies auto_delete. Default is False.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Exchange_type: AMQP defines several default exchange types (routing algorithms) that covers most of the common messaging use cases.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Auto_ack: acknowledgment is handled automatically once messages are received. By default auto_ack is set to False, and the receiver is required to manually handle acknowledgment.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>No_ack: It disable acknowledgment on the server-side. This is different from auto_ack in that acknowledgment is turned off altogether. This functionality increases performance but at the cost of reliability. Messages can get lost if a client dies before it can deliver them to the application.</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Auto_declare: If this is True and the exchange name is set, the exchange will be automatically declared at instantiation. Auto declare is on by default.
                            Publishers specify most the parameters of Consumers (such as they do not specify a queue name), but they can also specify the following:</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>Delivery_mode: The default delivery mode used for messages. The value is an integer. The following delivery modes are supported by RabbitMQ:</paragraph>

                            <bullet_list bullet="*">
                                <list_item>
                                    <paragraph>1 or “transient”: The message is transient. Which means it is stored in memory only, and is lost if the server dies or restarts.</paragraph>
                                </list_item>
                                <list_item>
                                    <paragraph>2 or “persistent”: The message is persistent. Which means the message is stored both in-memory, and on disk, and therefore preserved if the server dies or restarts.</paragraph>
                                </list_item>

                </bullet_list>
            </block_quote>
            <paragraph>The default value is 2 (persistent). During a send operation, Publishers can override the delivery mode of messages so that, for example, transient messages can be sent over a durable queue.</paragraph>
