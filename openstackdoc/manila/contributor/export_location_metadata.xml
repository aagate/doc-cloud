        <title>Export Location Metadata</title>
        <paragraph>Manila shares can have one or more export locations. The exact number depends
            on the driver and the storage controller, and there is no preference
            for more or fewer export locations. Usually drivers create an export location
            for each physical network interface through which the share can be accessed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Because not all export locations have the same qualities, Manila allows
            drivers to add additional keys to the dict returned for each export location
            when a share is created. The share manager stores these extra keys and values
            in the database and they are available to the API service, which may expose
            them through the REST API or use them for filtering.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Only keys defined in this document are valid. Arbitrary driver-defined keys
            are not allowed. The following keys are defined:</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="*">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><title_reference>is_admin_only</title_reference> - May be True or False. Defaults to False. Indicates
                    that the export location exists for administrative purposes. If
                    is_admin_only=True, then the export location is hidden from non-admin users
                    calling the REST API. Also, these export locations are assumed to be
                    reachable directly from the admin network, which is important for drivers
                    that support share servers and which have some export locations only
                    accessible to tenants.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph><title_reference>preferred</title_reference> - May be True or False. Defaults to False. Indicates that
                    clients should prefer to mount this export location over other export
                    locations that are not preferred. This may be used by drivers which have
                    fast/slow paths to indicate to clients which paths are faster. It could be
                    used to indicate a path is preferred for another reason, as long as the
                    reason isnâ€™t one that changes over the life of the manila-share service.
                    This key is always visible through the REST API.</paragraph>
