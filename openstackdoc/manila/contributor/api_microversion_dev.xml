            <title>Background</title>
            <paragraph>Manila uses a framework we called ‘API Microversions’ for allowing changes
                to the API while preserving backward compatibility. The basic idea is
                that a user has to explicitly ask for their request to be treated with
                a particular version of the API. So breaking changes can be added to
                the API without breaking users who don’t specifically ask for it. This
                is done with an HTTP header <literal>X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Version</literal> which
                is a monotonically increasing semantic version number starting from
                <literal>1.0</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If a user makes a request without specifying a version, they will get
                the <literal>DEFAULT_API_VERSION</literal> as defined in
                <literal>manila/api/openstack/api_version_request.py</literal>. This value is currently <literal>2.0</literal>
                and is expected to remain so for quite a long time.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Nova project was the first to implement microversions. For full
                details please read Nova’s <reference name="Kilo spec for microversions" refuri="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/tree/specs/kilo/implemented/api-microversions.rst">Kilo spec for microversions</reference><target ids="kilo-spec-for-microversions" names="kilo\ spec\ for\ microversions" refuri="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/tree/specs/kilo/implemented/api-microversions.rst"></target></paragraph>

            <paragraph>[1] - When fixing 500 errors that previously caused stack traces, try
                to map the new error into the existing set of errors that API call
                could previously return (400 if nothing else is appropriate). Changing
                the set of allowed status codes from a request is changing the
                contract, and should be part of a microversion.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The reason why we are so strict on contract is that we’d like
                application writers to be able to know, for sure, what the contract is
                at every microversion in manila. If they do not, they will need to write
                conditional code in their application to handle ambiguities.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When in doubt, consider application authors. If it would work with no
                client side changes on both manila versions, you probably don’t need a
                microversion. If, on the other hand, there is any ambiguity, a
                microversion is probably needed.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>If you are adding a patch which adds a new microversion, it is
                necessary to allocate the next microversion number. Except under
                extremely unusual circumstances and this would have been mentioned in
                the blueprint for the change, the minor number of <literal>_MAX_API_VERSION</literal>

                the API change.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>It is possible that multiple microversion patches would be proposed in
                parallel and the microversions would conflict between patches.  This
                will cause a merge conflict. We don’t reserve a microversion for each
                patch in advance as we don’t know the final merge order. Developers
                may need over time to rebase their patch calculating a new version
                number as above based on the updated value of <literal>_MAX_API_VERSION</literal>.</paragraph>
