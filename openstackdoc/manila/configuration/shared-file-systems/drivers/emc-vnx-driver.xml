        <title>Dell EMC VNX driver</title>
        <paragraph>The EMC Shared File Systems service driver framework (EMCShareDriver)
            utilizes the EMC storage products to provide the shared file systems to
            OpenStack. The EMC driver is a plug-in based driver which is designed to
            use different plug-ins to manage different EMC storage products.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The VNX plug-in is the plug-in which manages the VNX to provide shared
            filesystems. The EMC driver framework with the VNX plug-in is referred
            to as the VNX driver in this document.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This driver performs the operations on VNX by XMLAPI and the file
            command line. Each back end manages one Data Mover of VNX. Multiple
            Shared File Systems service back ends need to be configured to manage
            multiple Data Movers.</paragraph>

                            number of threads is 256.</paragraph>
                    </note>
                    <paragraph>To check the CIFS service status, use this command:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>NTP settings on Data Mover.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>VNX driver only supports CIFS share creation with share network
                        which has an Active Directory security-service associated.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Creating CIFS share requires that the time on the Data Mover is in
                        sync with the Active Directory domain so that the CIFS server can
                        join the domain. Otherwise, the domain join will fail when creating
                        share with this security service. There is a limitation that the
                        time of the domains used by security-services even for different
                        tenants and different share networks should be in sync. Time
                        difference should be less than 10 minutes.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>It is recommended to set the NTP server to the same public NTP
                        server on both the Data Mover and domains used in security services
                        to ensure the time is in sync everywhere.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Check the date and time on Data Mover:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">server_date &lt;mover_name&gt;
# mover_name = &lt;name of the Data Mover&gt;</literal_block>
                    <paragraph>Set the NTP server for Data Mover:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">server_date &lt;mover_name&gt; timesvc start ntp &lt;host&gt; [&lt;host&gt; ...]
# mover_name = &lt;name of the Data Mover&gt;
# host = &lt;IP address of the time server host&gt;</literal_block>
                    <note>
                        <paragraph>The host must be running the NTP protocol. Only 4 host entries
                            are allowed.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Configure User Mapping on the Data Mover.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Before creating CIFS share using VNX driver, you must select a
                        method of mapping Windows SIDs to UIDs and GIDs. EMC recommends
                        using usermapper in single protocol (CIFS) environment which is
                        enabled on VNX by default.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>To check usermapper status, use this command syntax:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">server_usermapper &lt;movername&gt;
# movername = &lt;name of the Data Mover&gt;</literal_block>
                    <paragraph>If usermapper is not started, the following command can be used
                        to start the usermapper:</paragraph>
                    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">server_usermapper &lt;movername&gt; -enable
# movername = &lt;name of the Data Mover&gt;</literal_block>

                    <paragraph>VLAN network is supported with limitations. The neutron subnets in
                        different VLANs that are used to create share networks cannot have
                        overlapped address spaces. Otherwise, VNX may have a problem to
                        communicate with the hosts in the VLANs. To create shares for
                        different VLANs with same subnet address, use different Data Movers.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>The <literal>Active Directory</literal> security service is the only supported
                        security service type and it is required to create CIFS shares.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>The time on Data Mover and the Active Directory domains used in
                        security services should be in sync (time difference should be less
                        than 10 minutes). It is recommended to use same NTP server on both
                        the Data Mover and Active Directory domains.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>On VNX the snapshot is stored in the SavVols. VNX system allows the
                        space used by SavVol to be created and extended until the sum of the
                        space consumed by all SavVols on the system exceeds the default 20%
                        of the total space available on the system. If the 20% threshold
                        value is reached, an alert will be generated on VNX. Continuing to
                        create snapshot will cause the old snapshot to be inactivated (and
                        the snapshot data to be abandoned). The limit percentage value can be
                        changed manually by storage administrator based on the storage needs.
                        Administrator is recommended to configure the notification on the
                        SavVol usage. Refer to Using VNX SnapSure document on <reference name="EMC support site" refuri="http://support.emc.com">EMC support

                    <paragraph>VNX has limitations on the overall numbers of Virtual Data Movers,
                        filesystems, shares, checkpoints, etc. Virtual Data Mover(VDM) is
                        created by the VNX driver on the VNX to serve as the Shared File
                        Systems service share server. Similarly, filesystem is created,
                        mounted, and exported from the VDM over CIFS or NFS protocol to serve
                        as the Shared File Systems service share. The VNX checkpoint serves
                        as the Shared File Systems service share snapshot. Refer to the NAS
                        Support Matrix document on <reference name="EMC support site" refuri="http://support.emc.com">EMC support
