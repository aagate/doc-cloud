        <paragraph>The Orchestration service provides a template-based
            orchestration engine for the OpenStack cloud. Orchestration
            services create and manage cloud infrastructure
            resources such as storage, networking, instances, and
            applications as a repeatable running environment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Administrators use templates to create stacks, which are
            collections of resources. For example, a stack might
            include instances, floating IPs, volumes,
            security groups, or users. The Orchestration service
            offers access to all OpenStack
            core services via a single modular template, with additional
            orchestration capabilities such as auto-scaling and basic
            high availability.</paragraph>
