        <paragraph>The OpenStack Block Storage service works through the interaction of
            a series of daemon processes named <literal>cinder-*</literal> that reside
            persistently on the host machine or machines. You can run all the
            binaries from a single node, or spread across multiple nodes. You can
            also run them on the same node as other OpenStack services.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To administer the OpenStack Block Storage service, it is helpful to
            understand a number of concepts. You must make certain choices when
            you configure the Block Storage service in OpenStack. The bulk of the
            options come down to two choices - single node or multi-node install.
            You can read a longer discussion about <reference name="Storage Decisions" refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/ops-guide/arch-storage.html">Storage Decisions</reference> in the

        <paragraph>OpenStack Block Storage enables you to add extra block-level storage
            to your OpenStack Compute instances. This service is similar to the
            Amazon EC2 Elastic Block Storage (EBS) offering.</paragraph>
