        <title>Contributing Documentation to Cinder</title>
        <paragraph>Starting with the Pike release, Cinder’s documentation has been moved from
            the openstack-manuals repository to the <literal>docs</literal> directory in the Cinder
            repository.  This makes it even more important that Cinder add and
            maintain good documentation.</paragraph>
        <note>
            <paragraph>Documentation for python-cinderclient and os-brick has undergone the
                same transition.  The information here can be applied for those
                projects as well.</paragraph>
        </note>
        <paragraph>This page provides guidance on how to provide documentation for those
            who may not have previously been active writing documentation for
            OpenStack.</paragraph>
        <section ids="using-rst" names="using\ rst">
            <title>Using RST</title>
            <paragraph>OpenStack documentation uses reStructuredText to write documentation.
                The files end with a <literal>.rst</literal> extension.  The <literal>.rst</literal> files are then
                processed by Sphinx to build HTML based on the RST files.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Files that are to be included using the <literal>.. include::</literal> directive in an
                    RST file should use the <literal>.inc</literal> extension.  If you instead use the <literal>.rst</literal>
                    this will result in the RST file being processed twice during the build and
                    cause Sphinx to generate a warning during the build.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>reStructuredText is a powerful language for generating web pages.  The
                documentation team has put together an <reference name="RST conventions" refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/rst-conv.html">RST conventions</reference> page with information
                and links related to RST.</paragraph>

            <title>Building Cinder’s Documentation</title>
            <paragraph>To build documentation the following command should be used:</paragraph>
            <literal_block highlight_args="{}" language="console" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">tox -e docs,pep8</literal_block>
            <paragraph>When building documentation it is important to also run pep8 as it is easy
                to introduce pep8 failures when adding documentation.  Currently, we do not
                have the build configured to treat warnings as errors, so it is also important
                to check the build output to ensure that no warnings are produced by Sphinx.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Many Sphinx warnings result in improperly formatted pages being generated.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>During the documentation build a number of things happen:</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The openstackdocs theme is applied to all of the files so that they
                                        will look consistent with all the other OpenStack documentation.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Once a patch is approved it is immediately released to the docs.openstack.org

                snapshot of that documentation will be kept at
                <reference refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/cinder">https://docs.openstack.org/cinder</reference>/&lt;release&gt; .  Changes from master can be

                of OpenStack’s documentation.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Each of the directories under source are for specific kinds of documentation
