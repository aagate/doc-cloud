            <paragraph>Copy the file etc/cinder/api-httpd.conf to the appropriate location for your Apache server, most likely:</paragraph>
            <paragraph><literal>/etc/httpd/conf.d/cinder_wsgi.conf</literal></paragraph>
            <paragraph>Update this file to match your system configuration (for example, some distributions put httpd logs in the apache2 directory and some in the httpd directory).
                Create the directory /var/www/cgi-bin/cinder/. You can either hard or soft link the file cinder/wsgi/wsgi.py to be osapi_volume under the /var/www/cgi-bin/cinder/ directory. For a distribution appropriate place, it should probably be copied to:</paragraph>
            <paragraph><literal>/usr/share/openstack/cinder/httpd/cinder.py</literal></paragraph>
            <paragraph>Cinderâ€™s primary configuration file (etc/cinder.conf) and the PasteDeploy configuration file (etc/cinder-paste.ini) must be readable to httpd in one of the default locations described in Configuring Cinder.</paragraph>
